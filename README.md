## Instalation

To use Crudoado you must first install [Adoadomin](https://github.com/anavallasuiza/adoadomin). Crudoado was conceived as an Adoadomin module.

With Adoadomin installed and working, require this package with composer:

```
composer require anavallasuiza/crudoado
```

After updating composer, add the ModuleProvider to the modules array in Adoadomin config:

```
ANavallaSuiza\Crudoado\CrudoadoModuleProvider::class
```

Copy the package config to your local config with the publish command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish
```

## Configuration

To start CRUDing your models just add them to the Crudoado config file as follows:

```
...
'models' => [
    'Users'      => App\User::class,
    'Blog Posts' => App\Post::class
...
```

And that's all! TA-D√Å! You will find a full-featured CRUD on you admin panel.
